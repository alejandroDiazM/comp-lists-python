#Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 7


#Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that have a 3 in them


#Count the number of spaces in a string


#Create a list of all the consonants in the string 
#“Yellow Yaks like yelling and yawning and yesturday they yodled while eating yuky yams”


#Get the index and the value as a tuple for items in 
#the list “hi”, 4, 8.99, ‘apple’, (‘t,b’,’n’). 
#Result would look like (index, value), (index, value)


#Find the common numbers in two lists (without using a tuple or set)
#list_a = 1, 2, 3, 4, list_b = 2, 3, 4, 5


#Get only the numbers in a sentence like ‘In 1984 there were 13 instances 
#of a protest with over 1000 people attending’


#Given numbers = range(20), produce a list containing the word ‘even’ if a number 
#in the numbers is even, and the word ‘odd’ if the number is odd. Result would look like ‘odd’,’odd’, ‘even’


#Produce a list of tuples consisting of only the matching numbers in these lists 
#list_a = 1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, list_b = 2, 7, 1, 12. Result would look like (4,4), (12,12)


#Find all of the words in a string that are less than 4 letters



#Use a nested list comprehension to find all of the numbers from 1-1000 
#that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9)
